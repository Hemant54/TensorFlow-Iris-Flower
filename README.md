# Iris flowers Category by Species

This repository contains how to use machine learning to categorize Iris flowers by species. It uses TensorFlow's eager execution to: (1) , (2) , and (3) 

* Build a model
* Train the model on example data
* Use the model to make predictions on unknown data.

## The Iris classification problem
Imagine you are a botanist seeking an automated way to categorize each Iris flower you find. Machine learning provides many algorithms to statistically classify flowers. For instance, a sophisticated machine learning program could classify flowers based on photographs. Our ambitions are more modestâ€”we're going to classify Iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their [sepals] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepal) and [petals] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petal).

The Iris genus entails about 300 species, but our program will classify only the following three:

* Iris setosa
* Iris virginica
* Iris versicolor

Fortunately, someone has already created a [data set of 120 Iris flowers] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) with the sepal and petal measurements. This is a classic dataset that is popular for beginner machine learning classification problems.
